Godot v4.3
GDExtensions

This is a VERY basic integration of Fmod with Godot, and it's main purpose is to show some familiarity with the Fmod API without getting buried in the details of a full implementation.
In part because I don't need it for Godot anyway, but I needed an existing engine for this specific project.

That being said the following demo includes:
  1. setting software format
  2. creating and initiating an Fmod object
  3. testing that the Fmod object is valid
  4. loading Master, String, and TestEvent banks
  5. getting event description and creating event instance
  6. playing/stopping event instance
  7. releasing event instance
  8. unloading banks
  9. releasing the Fmod object
